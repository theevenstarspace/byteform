# Schema Definition

Binary data encoding/decoding in Byteform is done using schemas. A schema is a set of rules that define how data is encoded and decoded. Schemas are defined using a simple, human-readable syntax:

```typescript
import { Struct, List, Text, f32, u8 } from '@evenstar/byteform';

const schema = new Struct({
  name: new Text(32), // Max 32 bytes
  age: u8, // Unsigned 8-bit integer, e.g. number between 0 and 255
  scores: new List(f32), // List of 32-bit floating point numbers
});
```

In the example above, we define a schema with three fields: name, age, and scores.

:::info
As you might have noticed, some types are defined using a constructor function, while others are defined using a shorthand. This is because some field types have additional configuration options that can be passed to the constructor.

However, looking ahead, constructable types start with the Uppercase letter, while shorthand types start with the lowercase letter.
:::

Byteform provides a set of built-in types that can be used to define schemas. We will cover the different types and their configuration options in the following sections.

***

## Struct

[Struct](/api/classes/Struct.md) is a collection of fields. It's a synonym for a JavaScript object.

It is used to group multiple fields together. A struct can contain any number of fields of any type.

The constructor takes an object as an argument, where each key-value pair represents a field in the struct. There are a few examples of how to define a struct:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="simple" label="Simple" default>
    ```typescript
    import { Struct, Text, u8 } from '@evenstar/byteform';

    /**
     * Define a schema with two fields: name and age.
     * Similar to JavaScript object: { name: 'Alice', age: 25 }
     */
    const schema = new Struct({
      name: new Text(32), // Max 32 bytes string
      age: u8, // Unsigned 8-bit integer, e.g. number between 0 and 255
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nested" label="Nested">
    ```typescript
    import { Struct, Text, u8 } from '@evenstar/byteform';

    /**
     * Define a schema with three fields: name, age, and address.
     * Similar to JavaScript object:
     * { 
     *    name: 'Alice',
     *    age: 25,
     *    address: {
     *      street: '123 Main St',
     *      city: 'New York',
     *      zip: '10001' 
     *    }
     *  }
     */
    const schema = new Struct({
      name: new Text(32), // Max 32 bytes string
      age: u8, // Unsigned 8-bit integer, e.g. number between 0 and 255
      address: new Struct({ // Nested struct
        street: new Text(64), // Max 64 bytes string
        city: new Text(32), // Max 32 bytes string
        zip: new Text(10), // Max 10 bytes string
      }),
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="With TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    import { Struct, Text } from '@evenstar/byteform';

    // Define a TypeScript type
    type Person = {
      name: string;
      age: number;
    };

    /**
     * Validate the schema against the TypeScript type.
     * If the schema definition does not match the TypeScript type, a type error will be thrown.
     */
    const schema = new Struct<Person>({
      name: new Text(32),
      age: new Text(32) // TypeError: age should have a type that implements number encoding/decoding.
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

***

## List

[List](/api/classes/List.md) is a collection of elements of the same type. It's a synonym for a JavaScript array.

Like a struct, list is used to group multiple elements together. A list can contain any number of elements.

The constructor takes a single argument, which is the type of elements in the list. There are a few examples of how to define a list:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="simple" label="Simple" default>
    ```typescript
    import { List, u8 } from '@evenstar/byteform';

    /**
     * Define a schema with a list of unsigned 8-bit integers.
     * Similar to JavaScript array: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
     */
    const schema = new List(u8); // Unsigned 8-bit integer, e.g. number between 0 and 255
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nested" label="Nested">
    ```typescript
    import { List, u8 } from '@evenstar/byteform';

    /**
     * Define a schema with a nested list of unsigned 8-bit integers.
     * Similar to JavaScript array: [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]
     */
    const schema = new List(new List(u8)); // Nested list of unsigned 8-bit integers
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="With TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    import { List, u8 } from '@evenstar/byteform';

    /**
     * Validate the schema against the TypeScript type.
     * If the schema definition does not match the TypeScript type, a type error will be thrown.
     */
    const names = new List<string>(u8); // TypeError: List data type should implement string encoding/decoding.
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

***

## Text

[Text](/api/classes/Text.md) is a string of characters. It's a synonym for a JavaScript string.

Text is used to represent strings of characters. Text has a maximum length.

The constructor takes a single argument, which is the maximum byte length of the text.

```typescript
import { Text } from '@evenstar/byteform';

const schema = new Text(32);
```

### Max Byte Length

For performance reasons, Text type was designed to have a maximum byte length. If you try to encode a string that exceeds the maximum byte length, an error will be thrown.

You are allowed to encode a string that is shorter than the maximum byte length. In this case, only written bytes will be used.

You can also set the maximum byte length manually by providing it as a first argument to the constructor.

```typescript
import { Text } from '@evenstar/byteform';

const schema = new Text(4098); // Max 4KB
```

You can read [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder/encodeInto#buffer_sizing) about how to determine the maximum byte length for a given string.

### text

Byteform also provides a shorthand for `new Text(256)`.

```typescript
import { text } from '@evenstar/byteform';

const schema = text;
```

***

## Number Types

Byteform provides an extensive set of number types.
